# Roadmap — PlantSim-Agent

**Status:** v0.1.1 released · v0.2 in planning · Last updated: 2026-06-30

This roadmap describes **what** lands **when**. For functional detail see [`spec.md`](./spec.md); for the design decisions behind these features see [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md).

Releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). `v0.x` releases are **pre-1.0** and may break public surfaces between minor versions, though we will document migrations.

---

## v0.1.x — Foundations ✅ shipped

**Theme:** make all three workflows usable end-to-end against a real Plant Simulation project, with citation-grounded answers.

### v0.1.0 — initial release (tag `v0.1.0`, 2026-06-30)

#### Phase 1 — Repository & specification scaffolding ✅
- [x] Directory skeleton, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `LICENSE`
- [x] `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- [x] `docs/spec.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`
- [x] `docs/kb-build-guide.md` (end-to-end PDF → indexed KB procedure)
- [x] Self-authored references migrated into `kb_minimal/` (`simtalk-api-index.md`, `simtalk-syntax-quick-ref.md`, `modeling-standards.md`, `knowledge-base-map.md`)
- [x] Initial git commit

#### Phase 2 — MCP server (core capability) ✅
- [x] `pyproject.toml`, FastMCP entry, `uvx`-compatible packaging
- [x] `storage/base.py` abstract `Index` + `storage/sqlite.py` FTS5 implementation
- [x] Help indexer: `help_md_to_fts.py` for the markdown half; PDF→markdown lives in `scripts/convert_help_pdf.py` (markitdown + clean + code-tag) — deliberately kept outside the MCP package so the runtime stays light, see [`docs/kb-build-guide.md`](./kb-build-guide.md)
- [x] `.psfm` indexer: `psfm_parser.py` + `psfm_indexer.py` (objects, code_units, flow_edges, Origin-inheritance resolution)
- [x] MCP tools: `search_help`, `get_api`, `find_method`, `find_callers`, `get_object_graph`, `search_code`, `validate_simtalk` (regex rules ST001-ST004)
- [x] `pytest` suite covering each tool with fixture data (122 tests at v0.1.0; real-corpus smoke against a large-scale logistics `.psfm` project)
- [x] W3.1 chapter-aware `pts_help_fullmd` indexer (entry_name two-stage lookup; 4944 docs)
- [x] P0 `did_you_mean` suggestions on miss (storage layer + dict return shape for `get_api` / `find_method`)

#### Phase 3 — Agents and skills ✅
- [x] `agents/plantsim-copilot.agent.md` — orchestrator with intent routing + mandatory citation-review loop
- [x] `agents/citation-reviewer.agent.md` — anchor-first, JSON-verdict subagent (`user-invocable: false`)
- [x] `skills/plantsim-kb-qa/` — Q&A cascade with `**Sources:**` contract; refuses on miss
- [x] `skills/plantsim-code-author/` — Symbol-Lookup-Cascade + API-Evidence-Table + Refuse-to-Guess
- [x] `skills/plantsim-project-analyst/` — four sub-procedures (locate / trace / map / audit); Inheritance Audit always-on

#### Phase 4 — Installation, evaluation, documentation ✅
- [x] `scripts/install.ps1` — symlink agents into `~/.copilot/` (with Developer-Mode pre-check)
- [x] ~~`scripts/install.sh` (Linux/macOS parity)~~ — **skipped**: Plant Simulation is Windows-only, so a Linux/macOS install path has no closed loop (the agent has no value without the PS host)
- [x] `plantsim-copilot-mcp init` wizard (+ `scripts/build_kb.py` shim) — interactive & `--non-interactive` modes; writes `config.toml`, optional `--build` invokes existing indexers
- [x] Evaluation set: 20 Q&A questions with hand-graded ground truth (`tests/eval/qa_questions.yaml`, all 20 passing against `kb_minimal/`)
- [x] Citation-reviewer recall test: 10 deliberately uncited responses (`tests/eval/citation_recall.yaml`, all 10 passing against pure-Python regex port)
- [x] Cold-install test — `tests/cold_install/test_cold_install.py` (3 automated subprocess tests) + [`docs/cold-install.md`](./cold-install.md) (7-step manual gate for VS Code integration, including the MCP-server registration step filled in by `v0.1.0`)

#### Phase 5 — Public release ✅
- [x] GitHub repository public, tag `v0.1.0` (pushed 2026-06-30)
- [x] Release notes (`docs/release-notes/v0.1.0.md`) + announcement drafts (`docs/release-notes/v0.1.0-announcement.md`)

### v0.1.1 — One-command MCP registration (tag `v0.1.1`, 2026-06-30) ✅

Quality-of-life patch addressing the v0.1.0 cold-install pain point (locate `mcp.json` per OS, hand-merge JSON without clobbering siblings, figure out the right `command` value).

- [x] **`plantsim-copilot-mcp register-vscode` subcommand** — locates VS Code's user-level `mcp.json` per OS, merges the `plantsim-copilot-mcp` entry idempotently, backs up the previous file before overwrite, refuses `--force`-less clobber
- [x] `install.ps1` calls `register-vscode` automatically at the end of symlink setup (non-fatal skip if the console script isn't on PATH yet)
- [x] README quick-start step 4 collapsed from a 30-line JSON snippet to one command; the manual JSON variant moved to [`docs/manual-mcp.md`](./manual-mcp.md)
- [x] Test count 122 → 141 (22 new tests for `register_vscode`)

### Post-v0.1.1 patches ✅

- [x] **kb-build-guide rewrite** (commit `816c260`) — new `scripts/convert_help_pdf.py` (markitdown + clean + code-tag pipeline); end-to-end procedure from PDF download to verified KB; docling kept as optional high-quality path
- [x] **Security fix: skills no longer symlinked globally** (commit `028a204`) — skills now live only in the repo and are loaded by the orchestrator via `read_file` from `~/.copilot/plantsim-agent/skills/`. Prevents skill-only invocations that would bypass the orchestrator's mandatory `citation-reviewer` dispatch. **Existing v0.1.0 installs still have stale skill symlinks under `~/.copilot/skills/plantsim-*`; harmless but cleanable with `scripts/uninstall.ps1`.**
- [x] **`list_section` MCP tool** (commit `dedd552`) — enumerate all entries in the help KB by chapter/kind/query filters. Answers "list all X" questions exhaustively. 10 new tests.
- [x] **`smart_lookup` MCP tool** (commit `0cdd1c0`) — one-shot cascade (exact API match → suggestion retry → FTS fallback) in a single tool call. Cuts per-question MCP round-trips from 5–10 to 1–2. 10 new tests.
- [x] **`plantsim-kb-qa` skill rewrite** — cascade simplified from multi-step `get_api` → `search_help` manual LLM-driven loop to single `smart_lookup` call. Added `list_section` for enumeration questions. Credit cost per question drops ~80%.
- [x] **Sources contract fix** (commit `63a906f`) — fullmd entries no longer generate broken links to a 250K-line single file. Instead uses structured breadcrumbs (`PTS Help > Ch > Category > Object > "section"`); multi-file KB entries keep working markdown links. Exact `section` value always quoted for Ctrl+F search.

## v0.2 — Quality

**Theme:** lift retrieval quality, tighten code validation, allow safe modifications.

- [x] ~~**`list_section(file_path)` MCP tool**~~ ✅ (done in post-v0.1.1, commit `dedd552`)
- [ ] **Vector retrieval** via the existing `Index` abstraction
  - Candidate stacks: `sentence-transformers` + `sqlite-vec`, or `lancedb`
  - Hybrid mode: BM25 candidates → embedding rerank
  - Decision recorded as ADR in `docs/decisions/`
- [ ] **Deeper `validate_simtalk`**
  - Tokeniser → minimal AST for the SimTalk subset
  - Catches: undeclared variables, type mismatches, unreachable branches
  - Replaces v0.1 regex rules (regex rules kept as a fallback)
- [ ] **`.psfm` write-back**
  - YAML round-trip safety (preserve comments, formatting, key order)
  - Mandatory git-clean or backup precondition
  - New MCP tool: `apply_patch(file, patch)` and `replace_method_body(path, new_body)`
  - Any generated SimTalk must carry the W2-style **API Evidence Table** — same `citation-reviewer` contract (no architecture change; reviewer already covers W3 from v0.1)
- [ ] **Call-graph Mermaid output** for `get_object_graph`

---

## v0.3 — Reach

**Theme:** broader audience, lower friction.

- [ ] **Non-Copilot model backends** — for users who want to point the agent at OpenAI / Anthropic / Azure / local Ollama with their own keys (likely requires forking to a non-Copilot agent runtime such as Cline or custom CLI)
- [ ] **VS Code extension packaging** — ship agents + skills + MCP wiring as a single `.vsix`
- [ ] **Cross-version Help support** — explicit version tagging so a user can have multiple Plant Simulation versions (2404, 2504, 2604) indexed side-by-side
- [ ] **Community templates** — a `templates/` library of common modelling patterns (shift logger, throughput collector, AGV dispatcher) contributed by the community

---

## v1.0 criteria

`v1.0` is reached when:

1. End-to-end install on a clean machine takes ≤ 5 minutes.
2. KB Q&A benchmark ≥ 90 % on a 50-question set across all three workflows.
3. No known data-loss bugs in `.psfm` write-back.
4. At least one external contributor (not the original author) has merged a non-trivial PR.
5. The public README has been reviewed by ≥ 3 practising Plant Simulation engineers.

---

## Things we are deliberately not promising

- A web UI or hosted SaaS version
- Real-time call-graph editing inside Plant Simulation
- Auto-generation of full Plant Simulation models from text descriptions (the W2 scope stops at SimTalk snippets and methods, not whole-model authoring)
- 3D layout / animation generation
